At PCSA, the safety of children is of paramount importance. We strictly adhere to global standards and Google Play’s policies to combat Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). Our policies ensure that our platform remains safe, respectful, and legally compliant for all users.

1. Zero-Tolerance Policy for CSAE

- We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or exploitation on our app. This includes:
- Sharing, uploading, or promoting CSAM.
- Engaging in grooming or predatory behavior toward minors.
- Soliciting or exchanging any inappropriate or illegal content.
- Any violation will lead to immediate account termination and may be reported to relevant law enforcement and child protection authorities.

2. In-App Reporting Mechanism

- Our app includes a user-friendly reporting mechanism:
- Users can report inappropriate or harmful content directly through [an in-app “Report” button/email/contact form].
- All reports are reviewed promptly by our moderation team.
- If you encounter any suspicious activity, please report it immediately through the app or by emailing us at [Your safety contact email].

- The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Local and international cybercrime laws
- Google Play’s CSAE and CSAM policies
- We continuously review our policies to align with evolving legal and safety standards.

4. Proactive Monitoring

- Monitor for potential CSAE activity.
- Remove violating content quickly and efficiently.

5. Age Restrictions and Access Control
